#### Project Manager : Nik Seif 

### Description
This application fetches data on 50 users and their daily metrics for hydration, steps, and sleep. This data is then displayed on the dashboard, where they can also see their friends' daily step goal.

### Goals
The goals of this project were to:
- Implement ES6 classes that communicate to each other as needed.
- Use object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation.
- Create a dashboard that is easy to use and displays information in a clear way.
- Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle).
- Implement a robust testing suite using TDD.
- Make network requests to retrieve data.

### Running FITLIT
- Clone the repo down to your machine. 
- Open the root folder in your terminal and enter `npm install` to install the dependecies 
- In your browser enter localhost:8080 in the search bar
- In your terminal run `npm start`. Go back to your browser and FITLIT should appear.
